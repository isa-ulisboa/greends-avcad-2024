    "### 1. Run simple linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple linear regression is the simplest form of regression analysis. It is also commonly used in Exploratory Data Analysis when we are interested in exploring if a given continuous response variable is affected by other independent (or predictor) variables. When we aim at modelling a response continuous variable with multiple linear regression using a big set of potential candidate variables, simple regression analysis is often used as a first filter to select a subset of candidate variables. Again, significant effect of a predictor on the response variable does not imply causation; but causation implies a significant an effect of a predictor on the response. Along with correlation analysis, regression is also important as a basis to establish hypothesis to be tested with more elaborated confirmatory statistics.\n",
