    "\n",
    "To follow the most appropriate statistical methods (e.g. hypothesis testing or statistical modelling approach), it is often important to test whether variables can be assumed to follow a normal distibution. If the used methods assume a Gaussian distribution but your data was drawn from a different distribution, the findings may be misleading or simply wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first commonly way of quickly checking the distribution of a sample of data is to plot a histogram.\n",
    "However, a more informative visualization is to plot a normal QQ plot, that plots the quantiles of each data value against theoretical quantiles corresponding to equal probability intervals of the standard normal distribution *N*(0,1). If most points fall near the diagonal line of the plot, then the distribution of data approximates a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more formal way of checking if a sample of data was drawn from a normal distribution is to run statistical normality tests. There are several alternative normality tests, each making different assumptions and considering different aspects of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Normal Q-Q plots\n",
    "\n",
    "The python module statsmodels provides the qqplot funtion to plot QQ plots. It can be applied to any distribution but by default assumes we are comparing our data to a Gaussian distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that theoretical quantiles (x-axis) get closer to each other towards the mean (=0.0, in this case) - this is because the quantile intervals that represent equal probability intervals (given by the area under the density probability curve) are lower near the mean than in both extremes of the distribution curve."
